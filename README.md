# SRTF Scheduling Algorithm in C

## Project Overview
This project implements the Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) CPU scheduling algorithm using the C programming language. The SRTF algorithm selects the process with the smallest amount of time remaining until completion and executes it. This approach aims to minimize the average waiting time for processes.

## Features
- **Efficient Process Scheduling**: Implements the SRTF algorithm to optimize CPU scheduling.
- **Dynamic Process Management**: Handles processes dynamically, allowing for varying arrival times and burst times.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input process details, including arrival time and burst time.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates and displays performance metrics such as average waiting time and turnaround time.
